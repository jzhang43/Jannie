# A React Native offline messaging app made for my girlfriend when she was abroad.

# Messages containing a title, image, date, and text body will appear in the main page of the app, in a swipable carousel style with the most recent message displayed first. Images are resized to 300x300 and longer text messages are viewable by scrolling. 

# TO USE: Edit the parameters for as many items as desired following the template in slides.js, which will then be loaded by messageLoader.js and displayed to the user. Upload the desired images into the project folder. Time and date are local the user's device. The user can view the app using Expo Go.

# SOME FUTURE ADDITIONS:
# -improving accessibilty of app
# -make backend to write messages easier
# -create timed minigame involving images
